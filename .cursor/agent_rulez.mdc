# Agent Rules

1. **Read documentation**
   - Always read relevant documentation before implementing features
   - Check existing code examples and patterns in the codebase
   - Understand dependencies and their APIs before using them
   - Review error messages and stack traces carefully

2. **Validate and test results**
   - Test implementations before presenting them
   - Verify that code works as expected
   - Check for edge cases and error handling
   - Run linters and fix any introduced errors
   - Validate that solutions meet the requirements

3. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Don't implement features or functionality that isn't explicitly requested
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Keep solutions simple and focused on current requirements
   - Add complexity only when there's a clear, immediate need

4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Reuse existing code and patterns when possible
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions/components
   - Avoid duplicating logic across multiple places
   - Refactor duplicated code when encountered

5. **Code quality and maintainability**
   - Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
   - Follow existing code style and conventions in the project
   - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage

6. **No Legacy Code, No Backwards Compatibility**
   - **Never keep legacy code**: Remove old code immediately when refactoring or replacing functionality
   - **No backwards compatibility**: Don't maintain compatibility with old APIs, formats, or interfaces
   - **Always forward-looking**: We never look back, only forward
   - **Clean breaks**: When changing something, make a clean break - remove old code completely
   - **No deprecated flags**: Don't mark things as deprecated, just remove them
   - **No migration paths**: Don't create migration code or compatibility layers

7. **GUI Design Principles**
   - **No space waste**: Maximize information density without clutter, use space efficiently
   - **No redundancy**: Avoid duplicating information or controls, consolidate similar elements
   - **Beautiful information aggregation**: Group related information logically and visually
   - **Reuse buttons**: Create reusable button components instead of duplicating button code
   - **Pictogram-only buttons preferred**: Use icon-only buttons when the action is clear from context, save text for labels when needed
   - **Playful & expressive design**: Add personality and visual interest while maintaining usability
   - **Maintain style consistency**: Extend and enhance existing styles rather than creating new conflicting styles
