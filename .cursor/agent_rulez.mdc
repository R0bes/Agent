# Agent Rules

1. **Read documentation**
   - Always read relevant documentation before implementing features
   - Check existing code examples and patterns in the codebase
   - Understand dependencies and their APIs before using them
   - Review error messages and stack traces carefully

2. **Validate and test results**
   - Test implementations before presenting them
   - Verify that code works as expected
   - Check for edge cases and error handling
   - Run linters and fix any introduced errors
   - Validate that solutions meet the requirements

3. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Don't implement features or functionality that isn't explicitly requested
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Keep solutions simple and focused on current requirements
   - Add complexity only when there's a clear, immediate need

4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Reuse existing code and patterns when possible
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions/components
   - Avoid duplicating logic across multiple places
   - Refactor duplicated code when encountered

5. **Code quality and maintainability**
   - Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
   - Follow existing code style and conventions in the project
   - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage
