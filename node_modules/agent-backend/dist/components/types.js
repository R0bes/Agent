/**
 * Component Architecture Types
 *
 * Components are self-contained units/modules that can implement one or more abstractions:
 * - Service: System-relevant services (e.g., LLM, Persona)
 * - Tool: Can be executed by agents, has MCP endpoints (LLM is also a tool)
 * - Source: Sends events into the system that land at the persona
