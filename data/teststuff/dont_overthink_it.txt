Thinking ... 
We need to respond with a short nerdy joke. It's a direct request: "Tell a short, nerdy joke. Don`t overthink it, just tell one. No long resoning process!"

So just produce a joke. The instruction: "Don`t overthink it" means we don't need to explain. 
Just give a short nerdy joke. Let's produce a joke, something about programming or math. 
For example: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs." 
Or "Why was the math book sad? It had too many problems." 
Something nerdy. Let's keep it short. 
Maybe "I would tell a UDP joke, but you might not get it." That is nerdy. 
Or "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#." Wait that's not good. 
Let's choose one: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs." That works. 
Or "I would tell a UDP joke, but you might not get it." That is a known one. 
Let's pick the UDP joke. It's short and nerdy. The instruction: no long reasoning. Just give the joke. We'll comply.
Response: I would tell a UDP joke, but you might not get it.
